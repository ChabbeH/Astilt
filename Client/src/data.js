Then, one year later, Yeezy finally released its brand new 450 silhouette with the adidas Yeezy 450 Cloud White. The adidas Yeezy 450 Cloud White is one of Yeezy’s most unique designs yet. Its simplified two-piece construction appears complex due to its extreme, molded foam sole. The sole clasps the mesh upper, acting as an exoskeleton to provide structure.

This colorway steps outside of the comfort zone of previous 350 Yeezy sneaker releases, which have remained subtle and mostly neutral primary colors and bright accents. The official colorway of the 'Frozen Yellow Yeezys' is actually Semi Frozen Yellow, Raw Steel and Red and features both of adidas pinnacle technologies, Boost cushioning and Primeknit sock-like upper. The hype for the yellow colored Yeezys was pushed to the roof before launch as Kanye West appeared with Kid Cudi and Takashi Murakami as 'Ye and Cudi toured the iconic artist's studio on a trip to Tokyo. In addition, the rumors throughout the sneaker world suggested the Frozen Yellow Yeezy would be an extremely hard to get release. As expected, the Semi Frozen Yellow was announced officially on November 13th, 2017 and released in limited quantities on November 18th, 2017.
